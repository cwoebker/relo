.. rubric:: About Relo

Relo is my first open source project. I started it because I felt like there
wasn't an easy way to search my own computer efficiently. At the beginning Relo
was just a tool for myself, but the I open sourced it at `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_
and transformed it into a library that others can easily use in their own python app.
